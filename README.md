## The assignment

### Create a static HTML page


* Place an element list (UL) in that

* Load your page with URL containing _ **#tags=red,blue,purple** _ at the end

* Write a Javascript that displays the tags from the URL in the list, where each tag is displayed as a separate list item

 * for example, if you have _ **#tags=red,blue,purple** _ in the URL, the list will be displayed with 3 items

* Write a Javascript, that will update the tag list every time the URL hash is changed

* Create your own well-structured CSS (Sass / LESS / Stylus...) styles

### Additional exercises (optional)

1. Adding and removing tags

    * Add an text input and a button to the page

    * Once the button is clicked the text of the input element is added as a new tag into the URL hash (#tags=red,blue,purple,mytag) 

    * By clicking on an item in the list the item will be removed from the list and from the URL

 
2. Wrap the code
    * Encapsulate the code as a visual component ( using React .js / any other alternative javascript framework you prefer such as Vue.js ... ) 
    * Place the component on the page three times

3. Visual appearance

    * Use some existing style library (material, bootstrap ...)
